## TMDB API Key

You are required to obtain your own [API key from TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api). 

## Delphi Wrapper

At the heart of this project is the unit `JD.TMDB.API.pas` which wraps the entire TMDB API. This is encapsulated in the `TTMDBAPI` component, which can be installed into your IDE.

## Test Application

There is a test application to demonstrage the usage of the TMDB API. Note that this app is in very active development at this time, and is far from ready.
